# Regen Tribe Website — Project Instructions

## Obsidian sync rule
**Always update the matching Obsidian write-up after making any changes to a page.**
- Obsidian vault: `/Users/soniawendorff/Library/Mobile Documents/iCloud~md~obsidian/Documents/obsid-mycolive/Regen Tribe/RT website/`
- Each page has a corresponding `.md` file there (e.g. `EDU TOOLS regentribe.co page.md`, `AGENCY regentribe.co subpage outline.md`, etc.)
- When content, copy, structure, or links change on a page → update the relevant Obsidian file to reflect what was built
- When a new page is created → create a new `.md` file in that folder documenting its structure

## What this project is
The marketing website for **Regen Tribe**, a Regenerative Neighborhood Accelerator.
Live at: **regentribe.co** — hosted on Cloudflare Pages, built with Next.js 15 static export.

## What Regen Tribe does
Regen Tribe helps people create, develop, and join intentional communities built around regenerative systems — circular economies, sustainable resources, and shared living. There are three arms:

1. **Tribes Platform** — a digital network app (tribesplatform.app) connecting people, regenerative neighborhoods, and service providers globally
2. **RT Agency** — hands-on consulting for groups developing regenerative neighborhoods
3. **Education** — training programs, guides (the 11-step Alchemy Guide), and the Agent Program vocational track

## Who the website is for
- Landowners and developers who want to build regenerative neighborhoods
- People seeking intentional community / alternative living
- Service providers (builders, designers, systems experts) serving the regenerative neighborhood space
- The broader global Regenerative Neighborhood Movement

## Website goal
The website is the **marketing hub** — introduce the mission, explain the ecosystem, and drive visitors to join the Tribes Platform, engage the agency, or enroll in education. It is NOT the platform itself (that lives at tribesplatform.app).

## Language rules
- NEVER abbreviate "Regenerative Neighborhoods" as "RN" — always write it in full
- NEVER abbreviate "Regen Tribe" as "RT" — always write "Regen Tribe" in full unless Sonia specifies otherwise
- The accelerator is called "Regen Tribe" (not "Regenerative Tribe")
- The platform is "Tribes Platform" (not "Tribe Platform")

## Tech stack
- Next.js 15.5.2 with `output: 'export'` (pure static HTML → `out/`)
- Tailwind CSS v4
- TypeScript
- Deployed to Cloudflare Pages via `npm run build`
- Build output directory: `out`
- Supabase for backend (env vars: NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL, NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY)

## Design system
- **Background:** `#ededed`
- **Text & headings:** `#363636`
- **Accent pink:** `#f16ab0`
- **Accent green:** `#6fc6a2`
- **Accent blue/purple:** `#808aeb`
- **Accent yellow:** `#ffe682`
- **Heading font:** Lora (serif, weight 400–600) via Google Fonts
- **Body font:** Open Sans via Google Fonts
- **Style:** editorial, PSV-inspired — dashed borders, pill buttons, colored dots on nav links, ○△□ shapes as decorative elements

## Animation — Framer Motion
- Import: `import { motion } from 'framer-motion'`
- **Scroll animations**: use `whileInView` + `viewport={{ once: true, margin: '-80px' }}`
- **On-mount** (above the fold, e.g. hero): use `initial` + `animate`, NOT `whileInView`
- **Standard variants** — always use these, do not invent new ones:
  ```ts
  const fadeUp = {
    hidden: { opacity: 0, y: 28 },
    visible: { opacity: 1, y: 0, transition: { duration: 0.65, ease: [0.25, 0.1, 0.25, 1] } },
  }
  const stagger = {
    hidden: {},
    visible: { transition: { staggerChildren: 0.1 } },
  }
  ```
- **Hover/tap on buttons**: `whileHover={{ scale: 1.03 }} whileTap={{ scale: 0.97 }} transition={{ duration: 0.15 }}`
- **Hover on nav links**: `whileHover={{ y: -1 }} transition={{ duration: 0.15 }}`
- Keep it subtle — NO parallax, NO dramatic effects, NO page transitions
- The ticker/marquee strip does NOT get Framer Motion (it has its own CSS animation)
- Client components only — any file using Framer Motion needs `'use client'` at the top

## Icons — Lucide React
- Import: `import { ArrowRight, Menu, X } from 'lucide-react'`
- Use `<ArrowRight size={14} />` for all button/link arrows — never hand-code SVG arrows
- Use `<Menu size={20} />` and `<X size={20} />` for the mobile hamburger/close
- Keep icon sizes consistent: 14px in buttons, 20px in nav/UI controls
- Never use Lucide icons to represent the logo or brand mark

## Logo rules
- ALWAYS use the real PNG logo files from `public/images/logos/`
  - `logo-black-text.png` — mark + wordmark, for light backgrounds
  - `logo-white-text.png` — mark + wordmark, for dark backgrounds
  - `logo-black-mark.png` — mark only, light backgrounds
  - `logo-white-mark.png` — mark only, dark backgrounds
- NEVER invent or recreate the logo as an SVG or any other format
- The ○△□ shapes used decoratively throughout the page are NOT the logo — they are design elements only
